   "My birthday wish for you: I hope you never stop enjoying the small things in life. Because that\u2019s what makes life worth living. I hope you take time to enjoy the present while working for a better future. I hope your year is full of memories, happiness, and adventure."

   ,
   "Through thick and thin, you were always there for me. Just know that I\u2019ll always be there for you when you need me."
   ,
   "There are friends and then there are best friends, happy birthday to the best friend I could have asked for!"
   ,
   "The best gift is the gift of friendship. So, that is what I got you for your birthday! Don\u2019t worry\u2026 I got you a real present too."
   ,
   "It\u2019s your birthday! Which means it\u2019s a great excuse to make some bad decisions, let\u2019s party it up!"
   ,
   "Best friends are the friends who keep your embarrassing secrets private. Thank you for always keeping my less than proud moments under wraps."
   ,
   "Hey it\u2019s your birthday and I just wanted to let you know that you\u2019ll never have to face a problem alone. I may not be able to solve every problem but I\u2019ll always be here for you when you need me."

   ,
   "I hope you have a very hoppy birthday. Full of beers and cheers!"
   ,
   "Best friends are like farts. Some are quiet. Some are loud. They embarrass you in public. They make you feel good. And they make you laugh."

   "For your birthday I got you hugs, kisses, and birthday wishes! Plus, dinner is on me!"
   ,
   "Sure, you\u2019re a year older, but we\u2019ve got a lot more years of shenanigans ahead of us. When we\u2019re in the old folks home we\u2019ll still be causing trouble!"
   ,
   "How old are you?! Nah, you don\u2019t look a day over amazing."
   ,

   ,
   "My best friend is sweeter than cake, more colorful than confetti, and hotter than a candle. And it\u2019s her birthday. Happy birthday!"

   "Best friends are like presents. You are always happy to see them. Happy birthday to the best present that life has given me."
   ,
   "You\u2019re not just my best friend. You\u2019re my sister. You may not have been born my sister, but we are family and we\u2019ll always be family."
   ,
   "It\u2019s not the number of friends. It\u2019s the quality of them. Thanks for being the best of the best. I hope you have a wonderful birthday!"
   ,
   "Life\u2019s too short to spend it with people you don\u2019t love. That\u2019s why I hang out with you so much. Happy birthday!"
   ,
   "It\u2019s your birthday, but let\u2019s not focus on the number of years gone by. Let\u2019s look forward to the years to come! I\u2019m planning on having a lot of fun in the coming years with my best friend!"
   ,
   "It\u2019s your birthday. You can dance if you want to. You can leave your cares behind. And if you need a dance partner, count me in!"

   ,
   "Most of my best memories have you in them. Thank you for being such a great friend and walking beside me on this journey called life."
   ,
   "Today is your birthday. It\u2019s the day we celebrate how ridiculously awesome you are!"
   ,
   "Soooo I forgot, which one of us is supposed to be the bad influence? Doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s your birthday. We can both be!"
   ,
   "You\u2019ve been my own personal cheer leader, my therapist, and my voice of reason. But most importantly, you are my best friend. Happy birthday. You are amazing!"
   ,
   "I love having someone in my life that I don\u2019t have to be an adult around. Thank you so much for bringing out the kid in me. I hope you have a joyful birthday!"

   "To my best friend, I wish you the best birthday ever!"
   ,
   "Hey best friend. It\u2019s your birthday. And you need to know that you rock. Thanks for being awesome."
   ,
   "Whenever you feel down or think just can\u2019t do something, just imagine me giving you a gigantic high five with a ridiculous look on my face. That should help. In the meantime though, happy birthday!"
   ,
   "Best friends must walk a fine line between stopping their friend from making big bad decisions and encouraging them to make small bad decisions that are a lot of fun. And no one does it better than my partner in crime."
   ,
   "Friends are like family that we get to choose. I\u2019m glad I made such a good choice!"
   ,
   "Happy birthday to my adventure buddy. I hope this coming year will be filled with many more fun adventures together!"

   "You\u2019ll be my best friend forever! \u2026\u2026 Because you already know too much."
   ,
   "Here\u2019s to all the inside jokes, all the stupid things we\u2019ve done together, all the memories we\u2019ve shared. May the years to come be filled with many more."
   ,
   "I probably wouldn\u2019t fight a tiger for you or a lion. But I would definitely shoo a cat that was giving you the stink eye! Happy birthday to the friend that I would do almost anything for."
   ,
   "Thank you for accepting me for who I am and always encouraging me to be the person I should be."
   ,
   "Thanks for being weird with me. You are the best!"
   ,
   "If you ever kill someone, call me first. I\u2019ll help you get rid of the body. That\u2019s your birthday present my friend, one free body disposal. The second time it happens, I\u2019ll have to charge."
   ,
   "There are a lot of people who know a lot of my stories. But you were there to help me create all those great stories!"
   ,
   "Happy birthday to my best friend. We are getting older, but we still have fun. In fact, we\u2019ll probably be up to same shenanigans when we are in an old folks home together!"
   ,
   "Time can change a lot but it will never change how much I care for you, my best friend."
   ,
   "Happy birthday to my best friend and part time therapist. Thanks for always listening to my problems and trying to help!"
   ,
   "Hey, you\u2019re weird. But it\u2019s okay because I\u2019m weird too. I\u2019m so glad we get to be weird together."

   ,
   "Happy birthday to the person who always says yes to my crazy ideas! My life wouldn\u2019t be nearly as fun without my best friend in it!"
   ,
   "I\u2019ve got lots of friends who make me laugh, but only you make me laugh so hard I snort. I\u2019m so lucky to have you as my best friend. I hope your birthday is as fun as you are!"
   ,
   "Thank you for always being there to save me from my dumb mistakes. I almost feel bad how many times you bailed me out. But because you are so thoughtful, you make just as many dumb mistakes as I do so I can bail you out and don\u2019t have to feel bad!"
   ,
   "Hey I just wanted to you to know that whenever you have a crazy idea, my only question will be: \u201cWhat time?\u201d"

   ,
   "For your birthday, here is my promise to you. If you yell Marco and I\u2019m in earshot, I will always yell Polo. Because that\u2019s what best friends do."
   ,
   "As long as you are my friend, you\u2019ll never have to do silly stuff alone. Have a wonderful birthday and if you do anything ridiculous I\u2019ll be right next to you doing the same thing."
   ,
   "I know I\u2019m not always a perfect friend. But I\u2019ll always be a loyal friend. I hope your birthday is as amazing as you are."

   "When we became friends, you didn\u2019t know what you were getting into. But now that we are best friends you are stuck with me. Mwhahahaha\u2026 I mean happy birthday!"
   ,
   "Sure, no one else finds our antics amusing. But we do and that\u2019s what is important! Happy birthday to my partner in crime."
   ,
   "Life\u2019s a road and I\u2019m glad to have you next to me on the journey. Through thick and thin, let\u2019s get to our destination together."
   ,
   "It\u2019s your birthday. Let\u2019s do something stupid together."
   ,
   "I\u2019d follow you through hell and back. But after we get done with that, I get to plan the next road trip. Happy birthday to my best and craziest friend."
   ,
   "Having lots of friends is great, but life just wouldn\u2019t be the same without a best friend to share everything with. Thank you for being the such an amazing friend."
   ,
   "If they made a movie about our friendship, I\u2019m not sure if anyone would watch it. But it would be my new favorite movie. Happy birthday to my best friend, you\u2019ll always be a movie star in my eyes!"
   ,
   "No matter how long we are apart, when we get back to together it\u2019s always just like old times."
   ,
   "I don\u2019t know how you put up with me, but I\u2019m so glad you do!"
   ,
   "When things are bad, let me know I\u2019ll try to make them better. When things are going great, let me know I\u2019ll celebrate with you. Middle of the night or middle of the day, I\u2019ll always be there for you."
   ,
   "It\u2019s my best friends\u2019 birthday! Let\u2019s make some fun mistakes!"
   ,
   "I love it how we finish each other\u2019s\u2026. So, for your birthday I just want to say\u2026."
   ,
   "If you decided to become a hermit and live out in the middle of nowhere, I\u2019d still visit you. Probably not often, but I\u2019d come, and I\u2019d bring booze."
   ,
   "Friends are the people who do all the weird things that you thought no one else did. Thanks for being weird like me. Happy birthday!"
   ,
   "It\u2019s hard to shop for a birthday present for someone who has everything. I mean you already have the best gift of all, a great best friend!"
   ,
   "It\u2019s your birthday, let\u2019s get you all liquored up so you\u2019ll do something embarrassing I can tease you about it later! Isn\u2019t that what best friends are for?"
   ,
   "We are different in a lot of ways, but that\u2019s what makes us such good friends. Puzzle pieces need to be different to fit together! Happy birthday to my favorite corner piece."
   ,
   "When it comes to friends, like Al Capone said, it\u2019s better to have four quarters than a hundred pennies. Happy birthday to my favorite quarter!"
   ,
   "If you could rate friends, I\u2019d only give you 1 star. That way I could have you all to myself! Happy birthday from the only best friend you\u2019re allowed to have."
   ,
   "Great friends are like jeans. When you find one that fits perfectly, keep them forever. Happy birthday to the greatest friend, I hope I don\u2019t ever wear you out!"

   ,
   "I know this past year was a rough one. But I\u2019m sure the coming year will be your best yet! Happy birthday, this is the year that everything will go right, I can feel it!"
   ,
   "My best friend deserves the best birthday. But I don\u2019t have the funds for the best birthday ever, but just know you deserve it!"
   ,
   "Did you know in some countries it\u2019s customary for the person having the birthday to pay for all the drinks? Good thing you don\u2019t live there. Drinks are on me tonight!"
   ,
   "Happy birthday to my amazing, cool, hilarious, best friend. There\u2019s no one else I would rather spend the day with!"
   ,
   "Hey, thanks for being you. You are one of a kind and my best friend. Happy birthday and keep being awesome."
   ,
   "Attention, this is a message from the best friend broadcasting service. It is your birthday. Hooray. Thank you for your attention. You may now continue being your awesome self."
   ,
   "Well, one year older. The years fly by. There are so many the things we\u2019ve done and seen. Time seems to slip away, but some of the best times have been spent with you."

   ,
   "Best friends are there in good times and bad. Through the sun and the storms. Best friends like you make the bad times tolerable and the good time even better!"
   ,
   "Friends are like trees, the older they get the more beautiful they are!"
   ,
   "It\u2019s so wonderful having such a great friend to grow older with. And let\u2019s face it, the older we get the better we get!"
   ,
   "It\u2019s your birthday, now you can bask in the glow of all those birthday candles on your cake!"

   ,
   "Hey bestie, you sometimes you need to be reminded of how great you are. Happy birthday to my awesome best friend!"
   ,
   "We are so loud when we hang out we must annoy everyone around us, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way!"
   ,
   "Happy birthday to my brother from another mother!"
   ,
   "Best friends are like chips and salsa, syrup and pancakes, cake and icing, they work so well together and just aren\u2019t the same without each other! Now let\u2019s enjoy some of that cake and icing!"
   ,
   "Why are you my friend? It\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s the thousands of little things that you do. It\u2019s the hundreds of inside jokes. It\u2019s the road trips. It\u2019s the late-night talks. It\u2019s you being you."
   ,
   "Friendship. F is for fun. R is for really fun. I is for ummm I don\u2019t know. Forget it, let\u2019s go grab some drinks and have fun for your birthday!"
   ,

   ,
   "Happy birthday! If anyone messes with you on your special day, just let me know. I\u2019ll punch them right in their stupid face. Just one of the many benefits of having an awesome best friend like me!"
   ,
   "If you fall, I\u2019ll be there to pick you up again. Right after I stop laughing. Happy birthday!"
   ,
   "I hope your birthday is so amazing you never forget it or that it is so amazing you can\u2019t remember it. Either way, happy birthday!"
   ,
   "It\u2019s your birthday! I would say let\u2019s go out have fun and act like idiots. But that\u2019s what we do every time we hang out! Here\u2019s to the greatest best friend there ever was."
   ,
   "For your birthday, I just wanted to remind you, I\u2019m always here if you need me. On the weekend or on a week day, 24\/7. If you call at 4am, I\u2019ll pick up. Here\u2019s to you bestie, I hope your special day is amazing!"
   ,
   "If you get arrested on your birthday, I won\u2019t be able to bail you out. Because I\u2019ll be right next to you."
   ,
   "You make me laugh harder than anyone else. You\u2019ve made me laugh so hard I peed myself. You are my best friend and always will be. I hope your birthday is as wonderful as you are!"
   ,
   "It\u2019s your birthday. I just wanted to take this opportunity to tell you \u2026 that you\u2019ll never have to do anything stupid alone."
   ,
   " As your best friend, it is my job to embarrass you. But it\u2019s your birthday, so I\u2019ll give you a break\u2026 until 12am."
   ,
   "Happy birthday to my best friend in the world. And since I\u2019m not tight with any aliens or astronauts, I guess you\u2019re my best friend in the whole universe!"
   ,
   "I don\u2019t have to tell you how awesome you are or how great of a friend you are. But it\u2019s your birthday, so I will. You are the best!"
   ,
   "Happy birthday to the friend who makes my family question my sexuality."
   ,
   "If I had to be stuck on a deserted island with only person, it would be you. Sure, you might not be a survival expert, but at least you\u2019d make desperately trying to avoid death fun!"
   ,
   "Sometimes it\u2019s a mystery why we choose certain people to be our friends. But with you it\u2019s obvious. You are an amazing person. And I hope you have an amazing birthday!"
   ,
   "You\u2019ll get lots of happy birthday wishes today. But who wishes you the happiest of happy birthday wishes? Me. That\u2019s who."
   ,
   "So, as you know, I\u2019m not exactly rolling in money. So, your gift isn\u2019t the best. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think you are the best. You are! I just can\u2019t afford the birthday gift you deserve."
